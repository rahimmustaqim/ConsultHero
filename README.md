# MYPortofolio — New UI

This is a simple responsive portfolio page for Rahim Mustaqim. Files added:
- index.html
- assets/style.css
- assets/script.js
- (Add your images and PDFs to the repository root or assets/)

Quick setup
1. Place the files in your repository (index.html at repo root, assets/ folder with style.js, script.js, images).
2. Update image & PDF file names as needed (pakil.pdf, jmb.pdf, rahim.jpg.jpeg, etc).
3. Preview locally:
   - Open index.html in a browser, or run a static server:
     - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
     - Then open http://localhost:8000

Publish to GitHub Pages
1. Commit files to a branch (e.g. `ui/portfolio-redesign`).
2. Push and open a Pull Request.
3. To publish immediately, enable GitHub Pages from repository Settings -> Pages -> Source: `main` or the branch you pushed.
4. Wait a minute and visit the pages URL (https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/).

Notes & next steps
- Replace placeholder images (assets/*.png/.jpg) with your real files. Optimize images (compress or convert to WebP).
- If you'd like I can create the branch and push these files and open a PR for you (I will need permission to write to the repo).
- I can also generate a screenshot preview or further polish the design (typography, color palette, or animations).
